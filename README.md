We are developing a system for potential undergrad college students to search for college options.

Initial Requirements
User account management, creation/deletion
Database of colleges and universities
Information collection from these colleges and universities (gpa, admissions, etc.)
Suggested colleges and universities based on user profile information
Portal that allows users add colleges to list to compare
Search method that allows the user to search based off of different characteristics of the college (location, acceptance rate, majors, etc)
Portal that allows user to filter through college/college search
List the application requirements for each school (common app, # of essays, etc)
List to add colleges that user plans on applying to
